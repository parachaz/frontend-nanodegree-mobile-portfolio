To complete this project I used following techniques to improve performance.
1. index.html: Use inline CSS instead of using external CSS files, since there not too many rules used on this page.
2. Use compressed images.
3. pizza.html: Use inline CSS instead of using external CSS files, since there not too many rules used on this page.
4. main.js: Improved performance by storing page elements in variable instead of retrieving them multiple times in foor loops.
